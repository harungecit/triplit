# Docker

Triplit publishes the following Docker images that run in the following environments:

- [Node.js](https://hub.docker.com/r/aspencloud/triplit-server/tags)
- [Bun](https://hub.docker.com/r/aspencloud/triplit-server-bun/tags)

## Running Triplit in Docker

To run Triplit in a Docker container, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:6543 -e LOCAL_DATABASE_URL="./app.db" aspencloud/triplit-server
```

This will run the Triplit server with SQLite as a storage engine at port `6543` on your host machine. The docker image uses SQLite as the storage engine and `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL` sets the path to the SQLite database file.

## Configuration

This will run a Triplit server with SQLite as a storage engine at port `8080` within the container. You may also pass in the following environment variables to configure the setup of the server process:

- `NODE_OPTIONS` - Node.js [options](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html) for the server
  `docker run <OTHER_PARAMS> -e NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" aspencloud/triplit-server`

Additional [environment variables](/self-hosting#configuration) can be set to configure the server.
